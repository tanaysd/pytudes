    "# Portmantout Words\n",
    "\n",
    "A [***portmanteau***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) is a word that squishes together two words, like  *math* + *athlete* = *mathlete*.  Inspired by [**Darius Bacon**](http://wry.me/), I covered this as a programming exercise in my 2012 [**Udacity course**](https://www.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212). In 2018 I was re-inspired by [**Tom Murphy VII**](http://tom7.org/), who added a new twist:  [***portmantout words***](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/portmantout/) ([***tout***](https://www.duolingo.com/dictionary/French/tout/fd4dc453d9be9f32b7efe838ebc87599) from the French for *all*), which are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **portmantout** of a set of words *W* is a string *S* such that:\n",
    "> 1. Every word in *W* is a **substring** of *S*.\n",
    "> 2. The words **overlap**: every word (except the first) starts at an index â‰¤ the end of the previous word.\n",
    "> 3. **Nothing else** is in *S*: every letter in *S* comes from the overlapping words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a word may appear more than once within *S*. Although not part of the definition, the goal is to get as short an *S* as possible, and to do it for a set *W* of over 100,000 words. This notebook develops a program that found these portmanteaux:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **preferendumdums** (prefer, referendum, dumdums): agreeable  uninformed voters.\n",
    "- **fortyphonshore** (forty, typhons, onshore): a dire weather report. \n",
    "- **allegestionstage** (alleges, egestions, onstage): a brutal theatre critique.\n",
    "- **skymanipulablearsplittingler** (skyman, manipulable, blears, earsplitting, tinglers): a nerve-damaging aviator.\n",
    "- **edinburgherselflesslylyricize** (edinburgh, burghers, herself, selflessly, slyly, lyricize): a Scottish music review.\n",
    "- **impromptutankhamenability** (impromptu, tutankhamen, amenability): willingness to see the Egyptian exhibit on the spur of the moment.\n",
    "- **dashikimonogrammarianarchy** (dashiki, kimono, monogram, grammarian, anarchy): the chaos that ensues when a linguist gets involved in choosing how to enscribe African/Japanese garb. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem-Solving Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "My intuition is that finding a shortest *S* is an NP-hard problem, and with 100,000 words to cover, it is unlikely that I can find the shortest possible solution in a reasonable amount of time. A common approach to NP-hard problems is a **greedy algorithm**: make the locally best choice at each step, in the hope that the steps will fit together into a solution that is not too far from the best solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, my approach will be to build up a **path**, starting with one word, and then adding **steps**  to the end of the evolving path, one at a time. Each step consists of a word from *W* that overlaps the end of the previous word by at least one letter. I will choose the step that seems to be the best choice at the time (the one that minimizes the number of **excess letters** added to the path, and will never undo a step, even if the path seems to get stuck later on. I distinguish two types of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unused word step**: using a word for the first time. Once we use them all, we're done.\n",
    "- **Bridging word step**: if no unused word overlaps the previous word, we need to do something to get back on track. I call that something a **bridge**: a step that repeats a previously-used word in order to provide a word ending that matches the start of some unused word.  Sometimes two words are required to build a bridge, but never more than two (with our word set). \n",
    "\n",
    "There's actually a third type of word, but it doesn't need a corresponding type of step: \n",
    "- **Subword**: a word that is a substring of another word. If, say, `ajar` is in *W*, then we know we have to place it in some step along the path. But if `jar` is also in *W*, we don't need a separate step for it&mdash;whenever we place `ajar`, we have automatically placed `jar`. We can save computation time by initializing the  unused words to be the **nonsubwords** in *W*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A subword will never be added as an unused word, but it may be used as a bridging word. (*Note:* I use the clumsy term \"nonsubword\" rather than \"superword\", because there are a small number of words, like \"cozy\" and \"july,\" that are neither subwords nor superwords.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the exact definition of the metric we are trying to minimize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Excess letters**: the number of unneccessary letters that a step adds, relative to a baseline model in which all the words are concatenated with no repeated words and no overlap between them. (That's not a valid solution, but it is useful as a benchmark.) So if a step adds an unused word, and overlap it with the previous word by three letters, that is an excess of -3 (a negative excess is a positive thing): I've saved three letters over just concatenating the unused word. For a bridging word, the excess is the number of letters that do not overlap either the previous word or the next word. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** In each row of the table below, `'ajar'` is the previous word,  but each row makes different assumptions about what unused words remain, and thus we get different choices for the step to take. The table shows the overlapping letters between the previous word and the step, and in the case of bridges, it shows the next unused word that the step is bridging to. The final column shows the excess score (and letters).\n",
    "\n",
    "|Previous|Step(s)|Overlap|Bridge to|Type of Step|Excess|\n",
    "|--------|----|----|---|---|---|\n",
    "| ajar|jarring|jar||*unused word* |-3| \n",
    "| ajar|arbitrary|ar||*unused word* |-2|\n",
    "| ajar|rabbits|r||*unused word*|-1|\n",
    "| ajar|argot|ar|goths|*one-step bridge* |0|\n",
    "| ajar|arrow|ar|owlets| *one-step bridge*|1 (r)\n",
    "| ajar|rani, iraq|r|quizzed| *two-step bridge*|5 (anira) | \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go over the examples:\n",
    "- **jarring**: Here we assume `jarring` is an unused word, and it overlaps by 3 letters, giving it an excess cost of -3, which is the best possible (an overlap of 4 would mean `ajar` is a subword, and we already agreed to eliminate subwords).\n",
    "- **arbitrary** and **rabbits**: unused word that overlap by fewer than 3 letters, so would only be chosen if there were no unused words with more overlap.\n",
    "- **argot** and **arrow**: One-step bridges; a bridge with the least excess (non-overlapping letters) would be chosen.\n",
    "- **rani, iraq**: a two-step bridge. Suppose `quizzed` is the only remaining unused word. There is no single word that bridges from any suffix of `ajar` to any prefix of `quizzed`. But `rani` can bridge from `'r'` to `'i'` and `iraq` can bridge from `'i'` to `'q'`. This two-word bridge has an excess score of 5 due to the letters `anira` not overlapping anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that unused word steps always have a negative excess cost (that's good) while bridge steps always have a zero or positive excess cost; thus an unused word step is always better than a bridge step (according to this metric).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Type Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I describe how to implement the main data types in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Word**: a Python `str` (as are subparts of words, like suffixes or individual letters).\n",
    "- **Wordset**: a subclass of `set`, denoting a set of words, plus some cached attributes.\n",
    "- **Path**: a Python `list` of steps.\n",
    "- **Step**: a named tuple of an overlap and a word. Adding `jarring` to `ajar` is `Step(3, 'jarring')`. \n",
    "- **Bridge**: a named tuple of an excess cost followed by a list of one or two steps, e.g. `Bridge(1, [Step(2, 'arrow')])`.\n",
    "- **Bridges**: a cached table mapping a prefix and a suffix to a bridge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two example bridges: \n",
    "\n",
    "      W.bridges['ar']['ow'] == Bridge(1, [Step(2, 'arrow')])\n",

    "# Overall Program Design\n",
    "\n",
    "I originally thought I would define a major function, `portman`, to generate the portmantout string *S* from the set of words *W*, and a minor function, `is_portman`, to verify the result. But verification was difficult. For example,  *S* =  `'helloworld'`, would be rejected as non-overlapping if parsed as `'hello'` + `'world'`, but accepted if parsed as `'hello'` + `'low'` + `'world'`. It was hard for `is_portman` to decide which parse was intended, which is a shame because `portman` *knew* which was intended, as it built up the path of steps, but  didn't return the path. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I decided on the following calling and [naming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman) conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    P = natalie(W: Wordset)          # Find a portmantout path P for a Wordset W\n",

    "    is_portman(P: Path, W: Wordset)  # Check whether P is a valid path covering W\n",

    "# Comparison to Tom Murphy's Program\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare my [program](portman.py) to [Tom Murphy's](https://sourceforge.net/p/tom7misc/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/portmantout/): \n",
    "- I used a greedy approach that builds up a single long portmanteau, one step at a time. \n",
    "- Murphy first built a pool of smaller portmanteaux, then greedily joined them all together. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm reminded of the [Traveling Salesperson Problem](TSP.ipynb) where one algorithm is to form a single path, always progressing to the nearest neighbor, and another algorithm is to maintain a pool of shorter segments and repeatedly join together the two closest segments. The two approaches are different, but they are both suboptimal greedy methods, andit is not clear whether one is better than the other. You could try it!\n",
    "\n",
    "(*English trivia:*  my program builds a single path of words, and when the path gets stuck and I need something to allow me to continue, it makes sense to call that thing a **bridge**.  Murphy's program starts by building a large pool of small portmanteaux that he calls **particles**, and when he can build no more particles, his next step is to put two particles together, so he calls it a **join**. The different metaphors for what our programs are doing lead to different terminology for the same idea.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of implementation:\n",
    "- I used Python (139 lines for the program without the exploratory questions).\n",
    "- Murphy used C++ (1867 lines), with a lot of extra functionality I didn't do: generating diagrams and animations, and running multiple threads in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "It appears Murphy  perhaps didn't quite have the complete concept of **subwords**. He did mention that when he adds `'bulleting'`, he crosses `'bullet'` and `'bulletin'` off the list, but somehow  [his string](http://tom7.org/portmantout/murphy2015portmantout.pdf) contains both `'spectacular'` and `'spectaculars'`. My guess is that when he adds `'spectaculars'` he crosses off `'spectacular'`, but if he happens to add `'spectacular'` first, he will later add `'spectaculars'`. Support for this view is that his output in `bench.txt` says \"I skipped 24319 words that were already substrs\", but I computed that there are 44,320 such subwords; he found about half of them. I think those missing 20,001 words are the main reason why my strings are coming in at around 554,000 letters; less than Murphy's 611,820 letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, Murphy's joins are always between one-letter prefixes and suffixes. I do the same thing for two-word bridges, because having a `W.bridges[A][B]` for every letter `A` and `B` is  the easiest way to prove that the program will terminate. But for one-word bridges, I allow prefixes and suffixes of any length up to a total of 6 for `len(pre) + len(suf)`. I can get away with this because I limited my candidate pool to the 10,000 `W.shortwords`. It would have been time-consuming to build all bridges for all 100,000 words, and probably would not have helped shorten *S* appreciably.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should say that I stole one important trick from Murphy. After I finished the first version of my program, I looked at his highly-entertaining [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=QVn2PZGZxaI) and [paper](http://tom7.org/portmantout/murphy2015portmantout.pdf) and I noticed that I had a problem in my use of bridges. My `natalie` function originally contained something like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "    ... unused_step(...) or one_word_bridge(...) or two_word_bridge(...)\n",
    "    \n",
    "That is, I only considered two-word bridges when there was no one-word bridge, on the assumption that one word is shorter than two. But Murphy showed that my assumption was wrong: for `bridges['w']['c']` I had `'workaholic'`, the best one-word bridge, but he had the two-word bridge `'war' + 'arc' = 'warc'`, which saves six excess letters over my single word. After seeing that, I shamelessly copied his approach, and now I too get a four-letter `bridges['w']['c']` (sometimes  `'war' + 'arc'` and sometimes `'wet' + 'etc'` or `'we' + 'etc'`)."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll stop here, but you should feel free to do more experimentation of your own. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things you could do to make the portmantouts more interesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use linguistic resources (such as [pretrained word embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)) to teach your program what words are related to each other. Encourage the program to place  related words next to each other. Maybe even make grammatical sentences.\n",
    "- Use linguistic resources (such as [NLTK](https://github.com/nltk/)) to teach your program where syllable breaks are in words, and what each syllable sounds like. Encourage the program to make overlaps match syllables. (That's why \"preferendumdums\" sounds better than \"fortyphonshore\".)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things you could do to make *S* shorter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lookahead**: Unused words are chosen based on the degree of overlap, but nothing else. It might help to prefer unused words which have a suffix that matches the prefix of another unused word. A single-word lookahead or a beam search could be used.\n",
    "- **Reserving words**: It seems like `haydn` and `dnieper` are made to go together in that order; they're the only two words with `dn` as an affix. Similarly, `womenfolk` and `menfolks` should go together in that order, for a 7-letter overlap. But if we happened to place `dnieper` or `menfolks` first, we would loose the chance of these nice overlaps.  Maybe there could be a system that assures the proper ordering, or a preprocessing step that joins together words that go together uniquely well. \n",
    "- **Word choice ordering**: Perhaps `startswith_table` could sort the words in each key's bucket so that the \"difficult\" words (say, the ones that end in unusual letters) are encountered earlier in the program's execution, when there are more available words for them to connect to.\n",
    "- **Learning**: The greedy approach minimizes the number of excess letters for each step. But some words are harder to place than others. Instead of just minimizing the excess, consider also the *expected* excess of each word, which could be learned by averaging over several random runs of `natalie`. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Here are some things you could do to make the program more robust:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write and run unit tests.\n",
    "- Find other word lists, perhaps in other languages, and try the program on them.\n",
    "- Consider what to do for a wordset that has missing bridges. You could try three-word bridges, you could allow the program to back up and remove a previously-placed word; you could allow the addition of words to the start as well as the end of `P`."
