    "# LLMs, Theory of Mind, and Cheryl's Birthday\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been [much](https://spectrum.ieee.org/theory-of-mind-ai) [debate](https://aclanthology.org/2023.conll-1.25/) [on](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/theory-mind-may-have-spontaneously-emerged-large-language-models) [the](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083) [degree](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01882-z) to which Large Language Models (LLMs) have a theory of mind: a way of understanding what other people know and don't know. In this notebook I explore one small part of the issue by asking nine LLM chatbots to solve the [Cheryl's Birthday Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl%27s_Birthday), a well-known logic puzzle in which different characters have different states of knowledge at different times. I gave the candidate solvers two tasks:\n",
    "1. Write a program to solve the problem.\n",
    "2. Solve a re-worded variant of the problem with different dates (so that they can't just retrieve a memorized answer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the ten solvers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [A human programmer](https://github.com/norvig/)\n",

    "# TLDR: Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The human solved both requests.\n",
    "2. None of the LLMs could reliably solve either request.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLMs were all familiar with the problem, so I didn't have to describe it in the prompt, just name it. Most of them correctly recalled the answer to the original problem: July 16. But none of them were able to write a program. They all failed to distinguish the different knowledge states of the different characters over time, both in the program they wrote and in the resoning steps for the second request. At least with respect to this problem, they had no theory of mind. (Perhaps that is in part due to the fact that very few of the Python programs they were trained on deal with theory of mind.)\n",

I introduced the idea of a *BeliefState*, a set of possible dates that a person believes might possibly be the birthday, and I modeled a character's *statement* as a function that takes a particular date as input, and returns true if the date is consistent with the statement."

    "\n",
    "*[ChatGPT 4o gives the following response, which starts with an excellent summary of the problem:]*\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Cheryl's Birthday\" problem is a well-known logic puzzle that can be solved using logical deduction. Let's first break down the problem before writing a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Cheryl gives Albert and Bernard a list of 10 possible birthdates, and tells them different information:\n",
    "- Albert knows the month.\n",
    "- Bernard knows the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cheryl provides the following 10 possible dates:\n",
    "- May 15, May 16, May 19\n",
    "- June 17, June 18\n",
    "- July 14, July 16\n",
    "- August 14, August 15, August 17\n",
    "\n",
    "Albert then says: \"I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know either.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard replies: \"At first I didn’t know when Cheryl's birthday is, but now I know.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Albert then says: \"Now I know when Cheryl's birthday is.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for Deduction\n",
    "1. From Albert's statement, we can deduce that Cheryl's birthday is not in May or June, because if it were, Bernard could possibly know the exact birthday if the day was unique (May 19 or June 18). Since Albert is sure Bernard doesn't know, we can eliminate May and June.\n",
    "2. After eliminating May and June, the remaining possible dates are:\n",
    "    - July 14, July 16\n",
    "    - August 14, August 15, August 17\n",
    "3. From Bernard’s statement, now knowing the birthday, we can deduce that Cheryl's birthday isn't on July 14 or August 14, because if it were, Bernard would still be uncertain (since both dates share the day 14).\n",
    "4. The remaining possible dates are:\n",
    "    - July 16\n",
    "    - August 15\n",
    "    - August 17\n",
    "5. Finally, from Albert’s statement, we deduce that Cheryl's birthday must be in July, because if it were in August, Albert wouldn’t be able to know the exact date. Thus, the birthday is July 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Program to Solve the Problem\n",
    "We can now write a Python program to generalize this solution and ensure it works for any list of possible dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- Step 1: The function groups the dates by month and by day.\n",
    "- Step 2: Based on Albert's statement, we eliminate the months of May and June.\n",
    "- Step 3: Based on Bernard's statement, we eliminate dates where the day appears more than once (i.e., both July 14 and August 14 are eliminated).\n",
    "- Step 4: Albert now knows Cheryl's birthday, so it must be in the month where only one date is left (i.e., July).\n",
    "- \n",
    "The program is designed to work with any given list of possible dates, not just the ones in the original problem."

Since Bo did not initially know the date, the day number Bo heard must appear in more than one month. Therefore, the days 16, 18, and 19 must be eliminated since they have corresponding unique months.*\" But that's just not right; they don't have unique months. \n",
