    "# Probabilities for Overtime in the Super Bowl\n",
    "\n",
    "In American football, if the game is tied at the end of 60 minutes of play, an overtime period commences, with these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a coin toss; the team that wins the flip has the option of possessing the ball first or second.\n",
    "- Both teams get one possession to attempt to score points.\n",
    "- After those two possessions, if the score is still tied, the game continues and the next score wins the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recap of (most of) the scoring rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A team scores **3** points for kicking a **field goal**. \n",
    "- A team scores **6** points for a **touchdown**. \n",
    "- After scoring a touchdown, if the game is not over, a team gets a chance to score **extra point**(s); they have the choice of going for either **one** point (easier) or **two** points (harder).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2024 Super Bowl went into overtime, and there was some criticism of San Francisco 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan, who, after winning the coin toss, elected to possess the ball first rather than second. As it turned out the 49ers scored a field goal and then the Chiefs scored a touchdown to win. If the 49ers had taken the ball second, and they had known that the Chiefs scored a touchdown first, they could have gone for their own touchdown rather than the field goal, and perhaps tied or won the game. There are two key question:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Is it better to possess the ball first  or second?\n",
    "2) After a team scores a touchdown, should they go for 1 extra point or 2?\n",
    "# TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answers:\n",
    "1) It is (slightly) better to **take the ball first.** (Why? Despite the avantage of possessing the ball second rather than first, it is more important to possess it *third*, because then if you score you win. So it is better to be first (and myabe third) than second (and maybe fourth).)\n",
    "3) The first team should **go for 1** extra point. If they succeed, the second team should **go for 2** extra points. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I make some simplifying assumptions, and then do a simulation  to verify these answers.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling the function `overtime()` below runs a random simulation of an overtime game and returns a pair of integers, (*A*, *B*), indicating the scores for the first team to possess the ball (**A**) and the second team (**B**). I could have done a detailed play-by-play simulation, but I decided to use a possession-by-possession simulation that considers just a few probabilities (and makes the inaccurate assumption that each possession is independent of the previous ones). You can set the following probability parameters (they will be the same for both teams):\n",
    "- **TD**: the probability of scoring a touchdown on a given possession. (By default 20%, the league average in recent years.)\n",
    "- **FG**: the probability of scoring a field goal on a given possession. (By default 25%.)\n",
    "- **go**: the *additional* probability of scoring a touchdown for a team that must score a touchdown or loseâ€“i.e., if team **A** scores a touchdown on their first possession, team **B** would never attempt a field goal (or punt). They will instead *go* for a touchdown, which they get with probability **go**. (By default 5%, but I'm not sure if that is a good estimate.)\n",
    "- **one**: the probability of succesfully kicking a 1-point conversion attempt. (About 98%.)\n",
    "- **two**: the probability of succesfully scoring on a 2-point conversion attempt. (About 48%.)\n",
    "- **A_extra**: 1 or 2, denoting what **A** should try for if they score a touchdown on their first possession.\n",
    "- **B_extra**: 1 or 2, denoting what **B** should try for if **A** scored 7 points on their first possession.\n"
