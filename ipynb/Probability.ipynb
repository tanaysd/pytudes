    "\n",
    ">*Probability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation. ... [Probability] is thus simply a fraction whose numerator is the number of favorable cases and whose denominator is the number of all the cases possible ... when nothing leads us to expect that any one of these cases should occur more than any other.*\n",

    "  <br>*For example, rolling a single die.*\n",
    "- **[Outcome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_%28probability%29):**\n",
    "  A possible result of a trial; one particular state of the world. What Laplace calls a **case.**\n",
    "  <br>*For example: the die comes up as* `4`.\n",
    "- **[Sample Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_space):**\n",
    "  The set of all possible outcomes for the trial.\n",
    "  <br>*For example,* `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.\n",
    "- **[Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_%28probability_theory%29):**\n",
    "  A subset of the sample space, a set of outcomes that together have some property we are interested in.\n",
    "  <br>*For example, the event \"even die roll\" is the set of outcomes* `{2, 4, 6}`.\n",
    "- **[Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory):**\n",
    "  As Laplace said, the probability of an event with respect to a sample space is the \"number of favorable cases\" (outcomes from the sample space that are in the event) divided by the \"number of all the cases\" in the sample space, assuming \"nothing leads us to expect that any one of these cases should occur more than any other.\" Since this is a proper fraction, probability will always be a number between 0 (representing an impossible event) and 1 (representing a certain event).\n",
    "<br>*For example, the probability of an even die roll is 3/6 = 1/2.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will explore these concepts in a concrete way using Python code. The code is meant to be succint and explicit, and fast enough to handle sample spaces with millions of outcomes. If you need to handle trillions, you'll want a more efficient implementation.

    ">As to the problem of how to divide the 100 Francs, I think I have found a solution that you will find to be fair. Seeing as I needed only two points to win the game, and you needed 3, I think we can establish that after four more tosses of the coin, the game would have been over. For, in those four tosses, if you did not get the necessary 3 points for your victory, this would imply that I had in fact gained the necessary 2 points for my victory. In a similar manner, if I had not achieved the necessary 2 points for my victory, this would imply that you had in fact achieved at least 3 points and had therefore won the game. Thus, I believe the following list of possible endings to the game is exhaustive. I have denoted 'heads' by an 'h', and tails by a 't.' I have starred the outcomes that indicate a win for myself.\n",

    ">\n",
    ">I think you will agree that all of these outcomes are equally likely. Thus I believe that we should divide the stakes by the ratio 11:5 in my favor, that is, I should receive (11/16)&times;100 = 68.75 Francs, while you should receive 31.25 Francs.\n",
