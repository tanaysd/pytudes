    "**[Gabe Gaster](http://www.gabegaster.com/)** proved me right when he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/gabegaster/status/593976413314777089/photo/1)  that he had used my code to generate a new list of dates that satisfies the constraints of the puzzle:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Albert and Bernard became friends with Cheryl, and want to know when her birthday is.\n",
    "- Cheryl wrote down a list of 10 possible dates for all to see:\n",
    "    - May 15,     May 16,     May 19,\n",
    "          June 17,    June 18,\n",

    "        August 14,  August 15,  August 17\n",
    "- **Cheryl** then privately tells Albert the month and Bernard the day of her birthday.\n",
    "- **Albert**: \"I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, and I know that Bernard does not know.\"\n",
    "- **Bernard**: \"At first I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now.\"\n",
    "- **Albert**: \"Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is.\"\n",

    "This is a slight modification of my [previous code](Cheryl.ipynb). The puzzle concerns these key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Possible dates** that might be Cheryl's birthday.\n",
    "- **Knowing** which dates are still possible; knowing for sure when only one is possible.\n",
    "- **Telling** Albert and Bernard specific facts about the birthday.\n",
    "- **Statements** made by Albert or Bernard about their knowledge of the birthday.\n",
    "\n",
    "I implement them as follows:\n",
    "- The global variable `dates` is a set of all possible dates (each date is a string).\n",
    "- `know(possible_dates)` is a function that returns `True` when there is only one possible date.\n",
    "- `told(part)` is a function that returns the set of possible dates that remain after Cheryl tells a part (month or day).\n",
    "- A statement is a function; *statement*`(date)`  that returns true if the statement is true given that `date` is Cheryl's birthday.\n",
    "- `satisfy(possible_dates, statement,...)` returns a subset of possible_dates for which all the statements are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous code](Cheryl.ipynb) I treated `dates` as a constant, but in this version the whole point is exploring different sets of possible dates. The easiest way to refactor the code was to make `dates` a global variable, and provide the function `update_dates` to set the value of the global variable. (It would be cleaner to package the dates into a non-global object, but it would be a big change to the  code to inject this all the way down to the function `told`, where it is needed.)"
